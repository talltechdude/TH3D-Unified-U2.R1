/**
* ************** How to use this firmware - READ THIS, yes actually read this. *********************************
*
* If you are having general compile issues please visit http://EZFirmware.TH3DStudio.com and use our web compile tool.
* You can upload this file to our server and have it compile it for you. This is much easier and quicker than your local PC.
*
* Uncomment means removing the 2 // in front of #define.
*
* EZABL SETUP NOTES:
* If you have EZABL uncomment the mount you are using with the printer.
* If you have a custom/unsupported mount uncomment #define CUSTOM_MOUNT and enter your offsets
* below in the CUSTOM MOUNT section. Refer to the EZABL guide to get your offsets.
*
* STEP 1:
* Uncomment the printer you want to flash and any options you want to use. The printers are sorted A-Z by brand name.
* Save the file before moving to the next step.
*
* STEP 2:
* Select PlatformIO > Build to build the firmware. Copy the Firmware.bin file from the ".pioenvs/LPC1769" to your SD card.
* Put the SD card into the printer with the power OFF. Turn on the printer, it will take a little longer to boot as it is flashing the firmware.
*
* STEP 3:
* Reset your eeprom. You can send M502 then M500 to reset the EEPROM OR on the printer LCD go to
* Control > Reset EEPROM to clear out the EEPROM to defaults.
*
* ERROR NOTES:
* If you get errors flashing READ the message it gives you. Turn off any AV systems and reboot the computer.
*
* If there is an option that has text make sure to keep the " marks around the text or the compile will fail.
*
* COMMUNITY REQUESTED FEATURES NOTE:
* All features in the community requested features section are provided as-is with no support from TH3D.

//******************** EXTRA FEATURES AND TWEAKS ****************************
//===========================================================================

// EXTRUDER SETTINGS -------------------------------

// Use to set custom esteps and/or reverse your E Motor direction if you are installing an extruder that needs the direction reversed.
// If you reversed the wiring on your E motor already (like the Bondtech Guide says to do) then you do not need to reverse it in the firmware here.

// If you want to change the Esteps for your printer you can uncomment the below line and set CUSTOM_ESTEPS_VALUE to what you want - USE WHOLE NUMBERS ONLY
// This option sets the esteps from the CUSTOM_ESTEPS_VALUE line below.
// If you need to reverse the e motor direction also enabled the REVERSE_E_MOTOR_DIRECTION option.
// Example EStep Values: TH3D Aluminum Extruder - 95 ESteps, TH3D Tough Extruder - 463 ESteps, BMG Extruder - 415 ESteps
// When installing a Tough Extruder or E3D Titan or Bondtech that is Geared you likely need to enable the REVERSE_E_MOTOR_DIRECTION option
//#define CUSTOM_ESTEPS
//#define REVERSE_E_MOTOR_DIRECTION
#define CUSTOM_ESTEPS_VALUE 463

// If you are using a pancake stepper enable the PANCAKE_STEPPER option to reduce the motor current to lower the stepper temperature
//#define PANCAKE_STEPPER

// THERMISTOR SETTINGS -----------------------------

// If you are using an E3D V6 Hotend with their cartridge thermistor (not glass version) uncomment the below line.
//#define V6_HOTEND

// If you are using a Tough Hotend from TH3D or any thermistors TH3D sells for your hotend uncomment the below line.
//#define TH3D_HOTEND_THERMISTOR

// If you are using a thermistor TH3D sells for your bed uncomment the below line.
//#define TH3D_BED_THERMISTOR

// If you are using a Keenovo with SSR and the Keenovo temperature sensor uncomment the below line.
//#define KEENOVO_TEMPSENSOR

// If you are using a known hotend thermistor value uncomment the below 2 lines and enter the thermistor number replacing the X after the #define KNOWN_HOTEND_THERMISTOR_VALUE
//#define KNOWN_HOTEND_THERMISTOR
//#define KNOWN_HOTEND_THERMISTOR_VALUE X

// If you are using a known bed thermistor value uncomment the below 2 lines and enter the thermistor number replacing the X after the #define KNOWN_BED_THERMISTOR_VALUE
//#define KNOWN_BED_THERMISTOR
//#define KNOWN_BED_THERMISTOR_VALUE X

// If you want to make thermal protection periods less or more adjust below. The number is in seconds.
// If you are getting false thermal runaway then increase the protection time. Do not make it over 300 for either setting.
#define HOTEND_THERMAL_PROTECTION_TIME 60
#define BED_THERMAL_PROTECTION_TIME 180

// BED SETTINGS ------------------------------------

// If you want PID tuning on your bed you can enable the below line. But PID on a bed is not typically needed. By default BED PID is disabled.
// This will be disabled when using automatic or manual mesh leveling with a 1284p board due to memory limitations.
//#define PIDBED_ENABLE

// If you are using an AC bed with a standalone controller (Keenovo) uncomment the below line to disable the heated bed in the firmware
//#define AC_BED

// Stock bed max is 120C for this firmware. Enable this to allow temps up to 150C. Your bed must support this temp for it to achieve the higher temperatures.
//#define BED_HIGHTEMP

// MISC --------------------------------------------

// If you have a 5015 fan that whines when under 100% speed uncomment the below line.
//#define FAN_FIX

// Use your own printer name
#define USER_PRINTER_NAME "DanceTech E3"

// If your printer is homing to the endstops hard uncomment this to change the homing speed/divisor to make it less aggressive.
//#define SLOWER_HOMING

//****************** COMMUNITY REQUESTED FEATURES ***************************
//===========================================================================

// HOME OFFSET ADJUSTMENT --------------------------
// If you need to adjust your XY home offsets from defaults then you can uncomment the HOME_ADJUST line below and enter your
// custom XY offsets. This is provided for convenience and is unsupported with included product support.
// How to use - measure (home XY then jog using the LCD 1mm at a time) the X and Y distance the nozzle is off
// the build plate and then put those as NEGATIVE values below, positive values will NOT work (move your endstops to fix a positve offset).
//#define HOME_ADJUST
#define X_HOME_LOCATION -10
#define Y_HOME_LOCATION -10

// LINEAR ADVANCE ----------------------------------
// See here on how to use Linear Advance: http://marlinfw.org/docs/features/lin_advance.html
//#define LINEAR_ADVANCE
// Change the K Value here or use M900 KX.XX in your starting code (recommended).
#define LINEAR_ADVANCE_K 0

// BL TOUCH ----------------------------------------
// If you want to use the BL-Touch install your EZOut Board, uncomment the 2 lines below, uncomment the CUSTOM_PROBE option in your printer section,
// and then enter your probe offsets in the CUSTOM_PROBE section above. DO NOT USE A "PIN 27" or "EZOUT" board with the EZBOARD.
//
#define BLTOUCH
// Here is where you set your servo pin. For EZBoard use P2_04
//#define SERVO0_PIN P2_04

// MANUAL MESH LEVELING ----------------------------
// If you want to use manual mesh leveling you can enable the below option. This is for generating a MANUAL mesh WITHOUT a probe.
// Mesh Bed Leveling Documentation: http://marlinfw.org/docs/gcode/G029-mbl.html 
// NOTE: If you want to automate the leveling process our EZABL kits do this for you. Check them out here: http://EZABL.TH3DStudio.com
//#define MANUAL_MESH_LEVELING

// POWER LOSS RECOVERY -----------------------------
// Continue after Power-Loss feature will store the current state to the SD Card at the start of each layer
// during SD printing. If this is found at bootup it will ask you if you want to resume the print.
//
// NOTE: This feature causes excessive wear on your SD card. This will disable junction jerk,  SCurve Acceleration, and Linear Advance due to RAM limitations.
//#define POWER_LOSS_RECOVERY

// MOTION SETTINGS ---------------------------------
// If you do not like the new Junction Deviation (Jerk) and/or S-Curve Acceleration then you can uncomment the below lines to disable each feature.
//#define JUNCTION_DEVIATION_DISABLE
//#define S_CURVE_ACCELERATION_DISABLE

//===========================================================================
//************************ EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES ****************************
//===========================================================================

// If you want to run the XYZ motors in 1/256 stepping mode with no interpolation uncomment the below line.
// This is a feature still in testing and there may be step loss or other issues with it.
// This does not set the E motor to 1/256 stepping due to step loss on E when this was tested.
//#define TMC_NATIVE_256_STEPPING

// Language - This is provided for convenience and is unsupported with included product support.
